## Data Sources

This project aggregates publicly available information from official Philippine
government sources:

- **House of Representatives**: https://congress.gov.ph
- **Legislative Documents and Records**: https://ldr.senate.gov.ph
- **eCongress**: https://econgress.gov.ph

## Data Structure

All data files are organized in the `data/` directory with subdirectories for
each entity type:

- `data/congress/` - Philippine Congress entities (8th through 20th)
- `data/group/chamber/` - Chamber entities (Senate and House of Representatives)
- `data/committee/` - Senate committee entities
- `data/person/` - Senator and representative entities

The following graph shows the current entities and their relationships in the
dataset:

### Entity Details

- **Congress**: Central entity representing each Philippine Congress (8th through 20th)
- **Chamber (Group)**: Represents Senate or House of Representatives for a specific Congress
- **Committee**: Senate committees that operate within specific congresses
- **Person**: Senators and representatives who serve in various congresses

### Relationship Hierarchy

The data follows a hierarchical structure:

1. **Congress** is the top-level entity
2. **Chambers** (Senate/House) belong to specific Congresses
3. **Committees** belong to specific Congresses
4. **People** are members of Chambers (not directly connected to Congress)

This structure accurately represents the bicameral nature of the Philippine Congress, where individuals serve as members of either the Senate or the House of Representatives for specific Congress sessions.

### Person Membership Structure

Person entities contain a `memberships` array that defines their chamber affiliations:

```toml
[[memberships]]
type = "chamber"
congress = 15
subtype = "house"  # Person was a House member in 15th Congress

[[memberships]]
type = "chamber"
congress = 16
subtype = "senate"  # Person was a Senator in 16th Congress
```

This allows tracking of politicians who may have served in different chambers across different congresses (e.g., moving from House to Senate).

## Impostor Syndrome Disclaimer

**We want your help. No, really.**

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not
ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?

We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code at
all, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open source
projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect code
isn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it's
trying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes.
That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.

Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can
help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the
project (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contribution
process). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as
a whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can see
the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.

**Remember:**

- No contribution is too small
- Everyone started somewhere
- Questions are welcome
- Mistakes are learning opportunities
- Your perspective is valuable
